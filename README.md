# Third Project - Reinforcement Learning

The objective of this assignment is to experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms to get the value function.

## Algorithms
SARSA

Q-Learning

Gradient Monte Carlo

Semi-gradient TD(0)

### Requirements

Python 3.9.12

##### Libraries
numpy == 1.26.2

matplotlib == 3.8.3

### Execution Instructions

The code in this repository was written in a Jupyter Notebook. Each part of the project is separated with its respective code. To execute the code, simply run each cell in sequence, one after the other. The entire code execution will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
